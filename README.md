# Breakpoint Chrome Extension

Description: (Project under development) Chrome extension to help designers and developers to add/export media-queries to their Responsive Design projects.

## History

Developing a new project I had to resize and write the media-queries code every time
So I decided develop an Google Chrome extension to help Designers and Developers add/export the code after resize the window with one click.

Pretty simple and useful.

## Usage

2. Start resize your window and see where your content are breaking.
3. Click into the Breakpoint extension choose your option.
4. Paste into your style file and do your things.

## Features
1. add/export breakpoints.
2. add/export breakpoints for retina display.
3. history of your last breakpoints.
