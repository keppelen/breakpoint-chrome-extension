# Breakpoint Chrome Extension

Description: (Project under development) Chrome extension to help designers and developers to add/export media-queries to their Responsive Design projects.

## History

Developing a new project I had to resize and write the media-queries code every time
So I decided develop an Google Chrome extension to help Designers and Developers add/export the code after resize the window with one click.
<br>
Pretty simple and useful.

## Usage

1. Add the extension to your Google Chrome browser.
2. Resize your window where you want to add the media-queries/breakpoint.
3. Click into the Breakpoint extension and copy the code.
4. Start to resize the window.

## Features
1. add/export breakpoints.
2. add/export breakpoints for retina display.
3. history of your last breakpoints.
